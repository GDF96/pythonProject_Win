4: 
5: A snake came to my water-trough
6: On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,
7: To drink there.
8: 
9: In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree
10: I came down the steps with my pitcher
11: And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough before me.
12: 
13: He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom
14: And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the edge of the stone trough
15: And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,
16: And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,
17: He sipped with his straight mouth,
18: Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,
19: Silently.
20: 
21: Someone was before me at my water-trough,
22: And I, like a second-comer, waiting.
23: 
24: He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,
25: And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,
26: And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a moment,
27: And stooped and drank a little more,
28: Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the earth
29: On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.
30: 
31: The voice of my education said to me
32: He must be killed,
33: For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold are venomous.
34: 
35: And voices in me said, If you were a man
36: You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.
37: 
38: But must I confess how I liked him,
39: How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink at my water-trough
40: And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,
41: Into the burning bowels of this earth?
42: 
43: Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?
44: Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?
45: Was it humility, to feel honoured?
46: I felt so honoured.
47: 
48: And yet those voices:
49: If you were not afraid you would kill him.
50: 
51: And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,
52: But even so, honoured still more
53: That he should seek my hospitality
54: From out the dark door of the secret earth.
55: 
56: He drank enough
57: And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,
58: And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,
59: Seeming to lick his lips,
60: And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,
61: And slowly turned his head,
62: And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,
63: Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round
64: And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.
65: 
66: And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,
67: And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders, and entered further,
68: A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into that horrid black hole,
69: Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing himself after,
70: Overcame me now his back was turned.
71: 
72: I looked round, I put down my pitcher,
73: I picked up a clumsy log
74: And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.
75: 
76: I think it did not hit him,
77: But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed in undignified haste,
78: Writhed like lightning, and was gone
79: Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,
80: At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.
81: 
82: And immediately I regretted it.
83: I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!
84: I despised myself and the voices of my accurs√®d human education.
85: 
86: And I thought of the albatross,
87: And I wished he would come back, my snake.
88: 
89: For he seemed to me again like a king,
90: Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,
91: Now due to be crowned again.
92: 
93: And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords
94: Of life.
95: And I have something to expiate:
96: A pettiness.
